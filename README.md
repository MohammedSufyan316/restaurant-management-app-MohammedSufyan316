# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Dining App - MohammedSufyan316

A modern full-stack restaurant management system where diners place orders by table, admins manage menus, and MongoDB never forgets an order.

Built using React, .NET Minimal API, and MongoDB ‚Äî because who said restaurant tech can't be delicious?

Users can view menus, select tables, place orders, and complete checkout.
